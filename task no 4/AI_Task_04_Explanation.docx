Feature Selection and Classification with and without Optimization: Project Explanation

1. Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying Parkinson's Disease using machine learning, with an emphasis on feature selection and comparing model performance before and after optimization. The workflow includes data preparation, feature selection, model training, evaluation, and deployment via a web app.

2. Data Preparation
- The dataset (parkinsons.data) is loaded and inspected.
- Non-informative columns (like 'name') are dropped.
- Missing values are checked and handled if present.
- Categorical variables are encoded using one-hot encoding.
- Numerical features are scaled using StandardScaler to ensure all features contribute equally.
- The data is split into training and testing sets (80/20 split) to evaluate model performance on unseen data.

3. Feature Selection Methods
Three main feature selection techniques are applied:
- Filter Method: SelectKBest with ANOVA F-test selects the top k features most correlated with the target.
- Wrapper Method: Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with Logistic Regression recursively removes less important features.
- Embedded Method: Random Forest feature importances are used to select the top k features based on their contribution to the model.

The top features from Random Forest are chosen for subsequent model training.

4. Model Training
Two types of models are trained:
- Using All Features: Logistic Regression and Random Forest are trained on the full feature set.
- Using Selected Features: The same models are retrained using only the features selected by the feature selection step.

Default parameters are used for all models, with no hyperparameter tuning.

5. Model Evaluation
Models are evaluated using:
- Accuracy: Proportion of correct predictions.
- Precision: Proportion of true positives among predicted positives.
- Recall: Proportion of true positives among actual positives.
- F1-score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- Confusion Matrix: Table showing true/false positives/negatives.

Metrics are compared for models trained with and without feature selection to assess the impact of optimization.

6. Model Saving
The best-performing Random Forest model (with selected features), the Random Forest model with all features, the scaler, and the list of selected features are saved using joblib and pickle. These files are used for deployment.

7. Web App Deployment (Streamlit)
A Streamlit app (app.py) is created to allow users to:
- Choose between models trained with all features or selected features.
- Input feature values via a user-friendly interface.
- Get predictions and probability scores for each class.
- The app loads the saved models and scaler, prepares user input, and displays results interactively.

8. Impact of Feature Selection (Optimization)
Feature selection can improve model performance by removing irrelevant or noisy features, reducing overfitting, and making the model more interpretable. In this project, metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are compared before and after feature selection. Improvements indicate that the model benefits from focusing on the most informative features, while decreases may suggest that some useful information was lost.

9. Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Streamlit (for deployment)

This document summarizes the key steps and concepts implemented in the project, providing a clear explanation of feature selection and classification with and without optimization.
