# Parkinson's Disease Prediction

This project provides a machine learning pipeline and an interactive Streamlit web app to predict Parkinson's Disease based on voice measurements.

## Project Overview

- **Data**: Uses the UCI Parkinson's dataset (`dataset/parkinsons.data`).
- **Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and scales features.
- **Feature Selection**: Compares models trained on all features vs. top features selected by Random Forest importance.
- **Models**: Trains and evaluates Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers.
- **Evaluation**: Reports accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix for both models, before and after feature selection.

## Streamlit App

The `app.py` file provides an interactive web interface for predictions.

### Features

- **User Input**: Enter values for all or selected features.
- **Model Toggle**: Switch between "Without Optimization" (all features) and "With Optimization" (selected features) models.
- **Prediction**: Displays predicted class and probability scores for each class.

### Required Files

Ensure the following files are present in the project directory:
- `model_rf_all_features.joblib` — Random Forest model trained on all features
- `best_model_rf_selected_features.joblib` — Random Forest model trained on selected features
- `scaler.joblib` — StandardScaler used for feature scaling
- `selected_features.pkl` — List of selected features used in the optimized model

These files are generated by running the Jupyter notebook (`main.ipynb`).

### How to Run

1. **Install dependencies** (if not already installed):

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Or manually:

   ```bash
   pip install streamlit scikit-learn pandas numpy joblib
   ```

2. **Run the Streamlit app**:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

3. **Use the web interface** to input feature values, select the model, and view predictions.

## Notes

- The app expects input features in the same order and format as used during training.
- If any required model or scaler files are missing, the app will display an error.
- The notebook (`main.ipynb`) contains all code for data processing, model training, evaluation, and saving the necessary files.
